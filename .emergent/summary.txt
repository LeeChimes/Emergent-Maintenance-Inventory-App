The previous AI engineer successfully brought the asset inventory app from inception to a stable state, implementing features like authentication, role-based access, inventory, QR scanning, and a comprehensive help system. The initial phase focused on stabilizing core navigation by integrating a  across many screens and addressing various UI/UX challenges, notably the problematic Photo + AI Processing button which was removed. Subsequent development addressed persistent service stability issues (ngrok conflicts) and critical logout button bugs, leading to a new delete and rewrite strategy for fixes. The application then underwent significant architectural changes: splitting the engineer's interface into Asset Inventory and Maintenance Hub and implementing a full User Management System for supervisors. Most recently, the supervisor dashboard was enhanced and unified, combining all functionalities into a single, scrollable interface. The PIN saving functionality, despite multiple attempts and backend changes, remains a recurring, high-priority bug. The current system provides distinct, role-based experiences for engineers and supervisors.

The objective is an asset inventory mobile app for the Chimes Shopping Centre maintenance team (2 supervisors, 3 engineers) to track materials and tools using in-app generated QR codes and provide stock-taking features. The app must be simple, visually clear, button-driven, and accessible, optimized for Android but cross-platform. Key features include: managing material and tool details, supplier information, low stock alerts, service records, check-in/check-out, photo capture, and unique QR code generation. Stock-take involves scanning items and inputting quantities/conditions. User roles dictate access levels, and security relies on PIN-based login. The app must have an auto error detection and reporting system.

**Recent Enhancements & Current Development Focus:**
*   **Smart Dashboard:** For supervisors, with One-Tap Operations.
*   **Supplier Management:** Comprehensive system including AI website scanning.
*   **Delivery Logging System:** Fully implemented for *all* users to log deliveries, capture photos, use AI for data extraction, manual input, audit logging, and universal search.
*   **Detailed Help and Support area:** With step-by-step instructions, an AI search assistant, and a Contact Supervisors (Lee Carter, Dan Carter) feature.
*   **Universal Navigation Header:** (Help, Home, Scan buttons) required on every page.
*   **Dashboard Redesign:** Team Activity removed from main page, archived to supervisor-only Audit Log. Smart Dashboard for supervisors only, engineers get a simple dashboard. Supervisor dashboard reordered: QUICK OVERVIEW, TODAY'S PRIORITIES, ALL THE BUTTONS (removing Inventory Health and Team Activity).
*   **App Restructuring (Engineer Focus):** After engineer login, split the app into ASSET INVENTORY and MAINTENANCE HUB (placeholder for now).
*   **User Management System (Supervisors):** Add/edit/remove users, set roles (Supervisor/Engineer), update user details (name, PIN). Supervisors can create other supervisors, 4-digit PINs are sufficient.
*   **Enhanced Supervisor Dashboard:** Unified access to Asset Inventory, Maintenance Hub, and Supervision Tools in one scrollable interface.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance:** FastAPI entry point and API router registration.
    -   **Changes:** Added and refined  CRUD endpoints for user management (add, edit, delete users, roles, PINs). Simplified  logic to directly handle name, role, and PIN updates and avoid  serialization errors, which was a source of persistent bugs.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Main login screen and supervisor dashboard.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Login flow updated: Engineers redirect to , supervisors to the enhanced dashboard. PIN entry removed for engineers.
        -   Supervisor dashboard restructured: Team Activity and Inventory Health removed. Layout reordered to include Quick Overview, Todays Priorities," "Asset Inventory," "Maintenance Hub," and "Supervision Tools" sections.
        -   Implemented robust logout functionality for supervisors with prominent red button, enhanced touch area, and direct logout without confirmation.
-   `/app/frontend/app/_layout.tsx`:
    -   **Importance:** Global navigation and error boundary.
    -   **Changes:** Configured routes for new screens: `audit-log.tsx`, `engineer-hub.tsx`, `maintenance-hub.tsx`, `user-management.tsx`.
-   `/app/frontend/app/settings.tsx`:
    -   **Importance:** User settings.
    -   **Changes:** Added "User Management" option, exclusively visible to supervisors. Implemented robust logout functionality without confirmation dialogs.
-   `/app/frontend/components/UniversalHeader.tsx`:
    -   **Importance:** Reusable header for consistent navigation.
    -   **Changes:** Home button made role-aware (engineers go to `engineer-hub`, supervisors to `/`). Applied to various screens (`inventory.tsx`, `deliveries.tsx`, help screens, `scanner.tsx`, `stock-take.tsx`, `suppliers.tsx`).
-   `/app/frontend/app/audit-log.tsx` (CREATED):
    -   **Importance:** Supervisor-only screen for archived team activity.
    -   **Changes:** Initial structure for displaying user actions, timestamps, and activity icons.
-   `/app/frontend/app/engineer-hub.tsx` (CREATED):
    -   **Importance:** New engineer dashboard.
    -   **Changes:** Presents two main choices: "ASSET INVENTORY" and "MAINTENANCE HUB". Includes an immediate logout button.
-   `/app/frontend/app/maintenance-hub.tsx` (CREATED):
    -   **Importance:** Placeholder for future maintenance features.
    -   **Changes:** Displays "Coming Soon" sections for PPMs, Call Outs, Reactive Jobs, and Work Orders.
-   `/app/frontend/app/user-management.tsx` (CREATED):
    -   **Importance:** Supervisor-only interface for managing users.
    -   **Changes:** Provides UI for adding new users, editing existing users (name, role, 4-digit PIN), and deleting users. Features role indicators and displays PINs. Handles form submission and refresh.

-   Re-implement accessibility features incrementally and stably.
-   Implement comprehensive offline functionality for the entire app.
-   Ensure the supplier "tick" button properly clears the form after submission.
-   Add more detailed help content for remaining categories (Inventory, Suppliers, Scanner, Troubleshooting).
-   Implement auto-updating help content (Step 5 of Help System development).
-   Continue with **Step 4: Update Navigation Flow** for the new app structure.
-   Continue with **Step 5: Visual Consistency Updates** for the new app structure.

The AI engineer successfully completed **Step 3: Enhanced Supervisor Dashboard** as part of a larger app restructuring. This involved a significant reorganization of the main supervisor dashboard (`/app/frontend/app/index.tsx`) to provide a unified experience. The layout now features "Quick Overview" and "Todays Priorities prominently at the top, followed by distinct, color-coded sections for Asset Inventory Management (with existing functions like View Inventory, Add Items), Maintenance Hub (housing Coming Soon categories like PPMs, Call Outs, Reactive Jobs, Work Orders), and Supervision Tools (including Smart Dashboard, Audit Log, Bulk Upload). The Team Activity and Inventory Health sections were removed, with team activity logging moved to a supervisor-only Audit Log. This provides supervisors (Lee Carter, Dan Carter) with a comprehensive, single-screen overview and access to all functionalities.

Concurrently, engineer logins () now bypass PIN entry and redirect directly to a new Engineer Hub (), offering a simplified choice between Asset Inventory and Maintenance Hub. Engineer login PINs were temporarily removed for easier testing.

A critical, recurring issue is the **PIN saving and display functionality** within the User Management system ( and ). Despite multiple attempts to fix, including backend simplifications to avoid  serialization and frontend display fixes, the system still results in a  on the backend when supervisors attempt to save a user's PIN, and the PIN does not display correctly on the user list. This currently prevents full testing of user authentication with newly set PINs.
