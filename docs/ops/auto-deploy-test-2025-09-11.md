# Auto-deploy test (backend)

- Purpose: trigger Actions on push to main to verify new automatic deploy behavior.
- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-09-11 14:09:03
- Notes: This is a harmless docs file. Safe to delete anytime.

Expected pipeline behavior:
1) CI job runs, prints that push is on main with no [skip deploy] flag.
2) Step logs: "Triggering Render deployâ€¦" then 2xx response.
3) Health check waits until service is healthy.
4) Smoke tests pass.
